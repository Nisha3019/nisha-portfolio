# My-portfolio
Welcome to my professional portfolio! Here, I showcase my work in both software engineering (focused on building responsive, user-friendly web applications) and data analytics (including dashboards, interactive visualizations, and data-driven insights). You will find sections covering my education, work experience, certifications, awards, and ways to get in touch.
